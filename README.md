# EDA Project 1: Heart Disease & Breast Cancer Prediction 🔍📊

This repository presents **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** applied to two healthcare datasets: **Heart Disease Prediction** and **Breast Cancer Prediction**. Through comprehensive analysis, we uncover patterns, examine relationships, and prepare data for predictive modeling in both domains.

## 🧩 Project Highlights

- **Sub-Project 1: Heart Disease Prediction** ❤️
   - EDA focused on identifying factors correlated with heart disease.
   - Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand health-related variables.

- **Sub-Project 2: Breast Cancer Prediction** 🧬
   - EDA to differentiate malignant and benign tumor characteristics.
   - Exploration of data distributions, feature relationships, and class imbalances.

## 📂 Files Included

- **`model.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing detailed EDA, visualizations, and analyses for both datasets.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies for easy setup.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitabh-7t/EDA-PROJ-1.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open `model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to follow along with the EDA process for both heart disease and breast cancer data.
